# Exercise 5 - ELT pipeline using Airflow 

These exercises are more open and less directed as in previous exercises. It requires you to think and design different solutions. 

## 0. Refactor handover code 

Refactor the handover code in Exercise3 to use Airflow to orchestrate it instead. Note that you will have to design and decide on how to do this. 


## 1. Liseberg pipeline

Continue developing the [Liseberg data pipeline](https://github.com/kokchun/Data-engineering-AI22/tree/main/Lecture-code/Lec5-Airflow_ELT). As a start you can try implementing the parts that isn't finished yet, but are listed in the README. Then you can continue to develop it as you wish.

## 2. Brainstorm projects

Now that you know the basics of ELT and data pipelines. Start brainstorming project ideas using the skills you've learnt this far in this course. In lecture 6 you will get an introduction to an extremely rich data source (SCB) that could help you in idea generation. You don't need to do your project, but it would be good practice and probably lots of fun to try it out.
